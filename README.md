# üëú Bag Price Prediction - Playground Series S5E2 (Kaggle)

This project is a machine learning regression task based on the Kaggle competition **[Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2)**. The goal is to predict the **price of bags** using structured product features.

>  Current best RMSE: `38.26` using **Lasso Regression**

## üß™ Evaluation Metric

The competition uses **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
```math
RMSE = sqrt(mean((ytrue - ypred)^2))
```
